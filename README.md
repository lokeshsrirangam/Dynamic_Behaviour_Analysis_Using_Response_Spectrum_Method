# Dynamic_Behaviour_Analysis_Using_Response_Spectrum_Method
Dynamic Behaviour of Different Slab Systems Under Seismic Loading


📌 Project Overview

This project studies the seismic performance of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings with different slab systems under earthquake loading. The analysis focuses on comparing Conventional Slab, Flat Slab, and Post-Tensioned (PT) Slab systems using Response Spectrum Analysis as per Indian seismic code provisions.

The objective is to understand how different slab systems behave under seismic forces and to identify their relative strengths and weaknesses in terms of structural safety and performance.

🎯 Objectives

To evaluate the dynamic behavior of RC buildings with different slab systems

To compare key seismic parameters such as:

Storey Displacement

Storey Drift

Storey Shear

Overturning Moment

To study the effect of building height (4, 8, and 12 storeys) on seismic response

To assess the suitability of flat slab and post-tensioned slab systems in seismic regions

🏗️ Slab Systems Considered

Conventional Slab System

Slab supported on beams and columns

Traditional load transfer mechanism

Flat Slab System (with Drop Panels)

Beamless slab directly supported on columns

Improved architectural flexibility

Post-Tensioned Slab System

Slab reinforced with prestressed steel tendons

Allows longer spans and reduced slab thickness

🧪 Methodology

Structural modeling carried out using ETABS

Buildings modeled as:

4-storey, 8-storey, and 12-storey RC frames

Seismic analysis performed using:

Response Spectrum Method

Seismic parameters evaluated based on:

IS 1893 (Part 1) provisions

Comparison done for all slab systems under identical loading and boundary conditions

📊 Analysis Parameters

Storey Displacement

Storey Drift

Storey Shear

Overturning Moment

Base Shear

🧾 Key Findings

Flat slab and post-tensioned slab systems are more flexible than conventional slab systems

Increased storey displacement and drift observed in flat slab and PT slab buildings

Conventional slab systems show better seismic resistance

Flat slab and PT slab structures, though architecturally efficient, are more vulnerable during earthquakes if not properly designed
